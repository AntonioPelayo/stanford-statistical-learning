1/1 point (graded)

Suppose we are interested in learning about a relationship between X<sub>1</sub> 
and Y, which we would ideally like to interpret as causal.

True or False? The estimate \hat{β<sub>1</sub>} in a linear regression that 
controls for many variables (that is, a regression with many predictors in 
addition to X<sub>1</sub>) is usually a more reliable measure of a causal 
relationship than  \hat{β<sub>1</sub>} from a univariate regression on X<sub>1</sub>.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

Explanation:

Adding lots of extra predictors to the model can just as easily muddy the 
interpretation of \hat{β<sub>1</sub>} as it can clarify it. One often reads 
in media reports of academic studies that "the investigators controlled for 
confounding variables," but be skeptical! Causal inference is a difficult and 
slippery topic, which cannot be answered with observational data alone without 
additional assumptions.

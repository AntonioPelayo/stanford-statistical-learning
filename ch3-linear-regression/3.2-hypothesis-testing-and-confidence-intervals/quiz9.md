## 3.2 Review Questions
### 3.2.R1
1/1 point (graded)

We run a linear regression and the slope estimate is 0.5 with estimated standard error of 0.2. What is the largest value of b for which we would NOT reject the null hypothesis that β<sub>1</sub> = b? (assume normal approximation to t-distribution, and that we are using the 5% significance level for a two-sided test; need two significant digits of accuracy)
 
> 0.892
 
Explanation:

The 95% confidence interval \hat{β<sub>1</sub>} ± 1.96 SE(\hat{β<sub>1</sub>}) contains all parameter values that would not be rejected at a 5% significance level.


### 3.2.R2
1/1 point (graded)

Which of the following indicates a fairly strong relationship between X and Y?

- [x] R<sup>2</sup> =0.9
- [ ] The p-value for the null hypothesis β<sub>1</sub>=0 is 0.0001
- [ ] The t-statistic for the null hypothesis β<sub>1</sub >= 0 is 30

Explanation:

The R<sup>2</sup> is the correlation between the two variables and measures how closely they are associated. The p value and t statistic merely measure how strong is the evidence that there is a nonzero association. Even a weak effect can be extremely significant given enough data.

Which of the following statements are true?

- [x] In the balance vs. income * student model plotted on slide 44, the estimate of beta3 is negative. correct
- [ ] One advantage of using linear models is that the true regression function is often linear.
- [ ] If the F statistic is significant, all of the predictors have statistically significant effects.
- [ ] In a linear regression with several variables, a variable has a positive regression coefficient if and only if its correlation with the response is positive.

Explanation:

We can see that the estimate of beta3 is negative because the slope of the 
student line is smaller than the slope of the non-student line. That is, being 
a student diminishes the effect of income on balance.

The linear model is almost always wrong; however, it is often still useful.

The F statistic tests the null hypothesis that none of the predictors has any 
effect. Rejecting that null means concluding that *some* predictor has an effect, 
not that *all* of them do.

Positive correlation only means that the univariate regression has a positive 
correlation. See slide 20 for a counterexample.

Suppose that in Ad Clicks (a problem where you try to model if a user will 
click on a particular ad) it is well known that the majority of the time an ad 
is shown it will not be clicked. What is another way of saying that?

- [x] Ad Clicks have a low Prior Probability correct
- [ ] Ad Clicks have a high Prior Probability.
- [ ] Ad Clicks have a low Density.
- [ ] Ad Clicks have a high Density.

Explanation:

Whether or not an ad gets clicked is a Qualitative Variable. Thus, it does not 
have a density. The Prior Probability of Ad Clicks is low because most ads are 
not clicked.

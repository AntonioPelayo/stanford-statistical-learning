## Quiz 18 4.4 Logistic Regression - Case-Control Sampling and Multiclass
### 4.4 R1
1/1 point (graded)

In which of the following problems is Case/Control Sampling LEAST likely to make a positive impact?

- [x] Predicting a shopper's gender based on the products they buy correct
- [ ] Finding predictors for a certain type of cancer
- [ ] Predicting if an email is Spam or Not Spam

Explanation:

Case/Control sampling is most effective when the prior probabilities of the 
classes are very unequal. We expect this to be the case for the cancer and spam 
problems, but not the gender problem.

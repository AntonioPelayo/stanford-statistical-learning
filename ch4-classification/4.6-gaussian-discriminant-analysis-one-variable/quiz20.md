Which of the following is NOT a linear function in x:

- [ ] f(x) = a + b<sup>2</sup>x
- [ ] The discriminant function from LDA
- [ ] δ<sub>k</sub>(x) = x(μ<sub>k</sub>/σ<sup>2</sup> − (μ<sup>2</sup><sub>k</sub>/2σ<sup>2</sup>
+ log(π<sub>k</sub>)
- [ ] logit(P(y=1|x)) where P(y = 1 | x) is as in logistic regression
- [x] P(y=1|x) from logistic regression

Explanation: 

P(y=1|x) from logistic regression is not linear because it involves both an 
exponential function of x and a ratio. Notice that f(x) = a + b<sup>2</sup>x 
is not a linear function of b, but is a linear function of x.

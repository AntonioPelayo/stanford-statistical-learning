### 4.8.R1
1/1 point (graded)

Which of the following statements best explains the relationship between 
Quadratic Discriminant Analysis and naive Bayes with Gaussian distributions in 
each class?

- [x] Quadratic Discriminant Analysis is a more flexible class of models than naive Bayes correct
- [ ] Quadratic Discriminant Analysis is a less flexible class of models than naive Bayes
- [ ] Quadratic Discriminant Analysis is an equivalently flexible class of models to naive Bayes
- [ ] For some problems Quadratic Discriminant Analysis is more flexible than naive Bayes, for others the opposite is true.

Explanation:

With Gaussian distributions, naive Bayes is equivalent to Quadratic Discriminant 
Analysis with the additional requirement that each class covariance matrix Î£<sub>k</sub>
be diagonal. Thus, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis is more flexible.

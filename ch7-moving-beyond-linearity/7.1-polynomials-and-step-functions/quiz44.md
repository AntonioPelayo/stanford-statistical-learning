Which of the following can we add to linear models to capture nonlinear effects?

- [x] Spline terms
- [x] Polynomial terms
- [x] Interactions 
- [ ] Arbitrary linear combinations of the variables
- [c] Step functions 

Explanation:

If we add any of these terms to our linear model, the model will be able to 
capture new nonlinear effects. The only exception is linear combinations of 
variables already in the model: any linear combination of those variables is 
already included in the model.

We compute the principal components of our p predictor variables. The RSS in a 
simple linear regression of Y onto the largest principal component will always 
be no larger than the RSS in a simple regression of Y onto the second largest 
principal component. True or False? (You may want to watch 6.10 as well before 
answering - sorry!)

- [ ] True
- [x] False

Explanation:

Principal components are found independently of Y, so we can't know the 
relationship with Y a priori.

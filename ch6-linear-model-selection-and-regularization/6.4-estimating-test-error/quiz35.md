1/1 point (graded)

You are fitting a linear model to data assumed to have Gaussian errors. The 
model has up to p = 5 predictors and n = 100 observations. Which of the 
following is most likely true of the relationship between C<sub>p</sub> and 
AIC in terms of using the statistic to select a number of predictors to include?

- [ ] C<sub>p</sub> will select a model with more predictors AIC
- [ ] C<sub>p</sub> will select a model with fewer predictors AIC 
- [x] C<sub>p</sub> will select the same model as AIC 
- [ ] Not enough information is given to decide

Explanation:

For linear models with Gaussian errors, C<sub>p</sub> and AIC and equivalent.

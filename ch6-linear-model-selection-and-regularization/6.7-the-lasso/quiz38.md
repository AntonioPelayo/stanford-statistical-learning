1/1 point (graded)

Which of the following is NOT a benefit of the sparsity imposed by the Lasso?

- [ ] Sparse models are generally more easy to interperet
- [ ] The Lasso does variable selection by default
- [x] Using the Lasso penalty helps to decrease the bias of the fits correct
- [ ] Using the Lasso penalty helps to decrease the variance of the fits

Explanation:

Restricting ourselves to simpler models by including a Lasso penalty will 
generally decrease the variance of the fits at the cost of higher bias.

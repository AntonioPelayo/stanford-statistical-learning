### 2.Q.1
1/1 point (graded)

For each of the following parts, indicate whether we would generally expect the performance of a flexible statistical learning method to be better or worse than an inflexible model.

The sample size n is extremely large, and the number of predictors p is small:

- [x] Flexible is better
- [ ] Flexible is worse

Explanation:

A flexible model will allow us to take full advantage of our large sample size.


### 2.Q.2
1/1 point (graded)

The number of predictors p is extremely large, and the sample size  n is small:
- [ ] Flexible is better
- [x] Flexible is worse

Explanation:

The flexible model will cause overfitting due to our small sample size.


### 2.Q.3
1/1 point (graded)

The relationship between the predictors and response is highly non-linear:

- [x] Flexible is better
- [ ] Flexible is worse

Explanation:

A flexible model will be necessary to find the nonlinear effect.


### 2.Q.4
1/1 point (graded)

The variance of the error terms, i.e. σ 2 = Var(ϵ), is extremely high:
- [ ] Flexible is better
- [x] Flexible is worse

Explanation: 

A flexible model will cause us to fit too much of the noise in the problem.

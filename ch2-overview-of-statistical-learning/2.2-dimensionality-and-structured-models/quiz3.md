1/1 point (graded)
A hypercube with side length 1 in d dimensions is defined to be the set of points (x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, ..., x<sub>d</sub>) such that 0 ≤ x<sub>j</sub> ≤ 1 for all j = 1, 2, ..., d. The boundary of the hypercube is defined to be the set of all points such that there exists a j for which 0 ≤ x<sub>j</sub> ≤ .05 or .95 ≤ x<sub>j</sub> ≤ 1 (namely, the boundary is the set of all points that have at least one dimension in the most extreme 10% of possible values). What proportion of the points in a hypercube of dimension 50 are in the boundary? (hint: you may want to calculate the volume of the non-boundary region)

0.995

Explanation: 
We know that the volume of the whole hypercube is 1<sup>50</sup> = 1. The volume of the interior of the hypercube is 0.950 = 0.005. Thus, the volume of the boundary is 1-0.005 = 0.995.
